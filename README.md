# Facebook_AccessToken_Validation

This code uses the facebook-sdk library to create a GraphAPI object using the given access token. It then makes a request to the '/me' endpoint, which returns information about the authenticated user. If the request is successful, it means the token is valid, if it fails, it means the token is invalid.

Please note that if the token is valid but the permissions are not sufficient, the request will fail, so make sure you have the right permissions for the data you're trying to access. Additionally, after generating access token, it is a best practice to validate the token before using it, since it will expire after some time.

Also, please keep in mind that when making this request, you need to have an internet connection, otherwise the request will fail.
